    <p class="container">My name is Binh Tang. I am a undergraduate student of <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/">CSUSB</a> pursuing bachelor's degree of Computer Science. I was interest choose Computer Science because it help me learn the programming language can create game project for game development and the other field industry as my computer science degree. I was dream can become a game design industry that I want to create with my passion, the other school was denied and I'm luckily that CSUSB choose me of part. I don't know what is computer science most some people said it a good degree when you can become part of game design for programming. <br><br>
     I had experienced working in programming languages like Javascript, HTML/CSS, C++, C#, Dart through academic courses. I am skilled at working with databases such as SQL, Unreal Engine, Unity, and Python. I can fulfill the tasks with accuracy and efficiency. I believe that my ability can be helpful to strongly apply foundation in computer science principles and hands-on programming skills to real-world software development challenges.<br><br>
    My interest are in Game development, App development and Artificial Intelligence. My goal in my life want to earn a Computer Science degree and become developer. </p>
